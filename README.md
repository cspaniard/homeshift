# HomeShift

This a program inspired by the great Time Shift application used in Linux for taking 'snapshots' of the system for easy rollback.

Time Shift does not recommend backing up user's home directories, therefore I would like to clone timeshift's concepts and adapt them to take snapshots of such directories.

The goal is to make HomeShift and TimeShift complementary in functionality.
